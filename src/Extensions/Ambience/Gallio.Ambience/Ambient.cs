    /// <para>
    /// The Ambient object store may be used to model the persistent state of the
    /// testing environment for end-to-end black-box integration testing.  It is particularly
    /// useful for decoupling tests that incorporate stateful components such as
    /// databases (that are not wiped and restored each time) or time-sensitive processes
    /// such as asynchronous jobs.
    /// </para>
    /// </remarks>
    /// <example>
    /// <para>
    /// Suppose we are testing a periodic invoicing process.  The business requirement
    /// dictates that on the last day of each month, an invoice must be generated
    /// and delivered electronically to all customers with an outstanding balance
    /// in their account.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// To verify this requirement, we might choose to adopt a combination of unit
    /// testing and integration testing methodologies.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// First, we will write unit tests for each component involved in the invoicing
    /// process including the invoice generator, data access code, electronic delivery apparatus,
    /// and the periodic job scheduler.  During unit testing, we will probably
    /// replace the periodic job scheduler with a mock or stub implementation that simulates
    /// the end-of-month trigger mechanism.  This is fast and quite effective.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Next, for additional confidence we will want to verify that the system works
    /// completely as an integrated whole.  Perhaps the job scheduling mechanism is built
    /// on 3rd party tools that must be correctly configured for the environment.  In
    /// this situation, we might consider implementing an end-to-end system test
    /// with nothing mocked out.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// We can implement an end-to-end test like this:
    /// <list type="bullet">
    /// <item>Write a few test scripts that are scheduled to run on a regular basis
    /// and that generate transactions that will be reflected in the invoices.</item>
    /// <item>For each transaction, such as creating a new account or purchasing a service,
    /// the scripts should make a record in the <see cref="Ambient"/> object store.</item>
    /// <item>Write a few more test scripts that are scheduled to run after the invoicing
    /// process occurs.  They should verify the contents of the invoices based on previously
    /// stored records in the <see cref="Ambient"/> object store.</item>
    /// </list>
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Of course, in this example it can take up to a month to obtain confirmation that
    /// the invoicing process functioned as expected.  Consequently, we should not rely
    /// on this approach exclusively for our testing purposes.  Nevertheless, it may be
    /// useful as part of an on-going Quality Assurance audit.
