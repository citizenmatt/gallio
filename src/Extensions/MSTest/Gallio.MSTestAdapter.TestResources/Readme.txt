MSTest Test Resources

This project contains code resources used for testing the behavior
of Gallio's test enumeration and execution phases.  The tests in this
project are not intended to be run directly and will probably fail.
They have been placed in this separate project to make it less likely
that someone will attempt to run them by mistake.
