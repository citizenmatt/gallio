    <para>
      Sets the filter set to apply, which consists of a sequence of one or more inclusion
      or exclusion filter rules prefixed using 'include' (optional) or 'exclude'.
    </para>

  <remarks>
    <para>
      A filter rule consists of zero or more filter expressions
      that may be combined using 'and', 'or', and 'not' and grouped with
      parentheses.  A filter expression consists of a filter key followed by one or
      more comma-delimited matching values in the form 'key: value, "quoted value",
      /regular expression/'.
    </para>
    <para>
      The filter grammar is defined as follows:

      <item>By default this property takes the value "*", which means the "Any" filter will be applied.</item>
      <item>
        The operator precedence is, from highest to lowest: NOT, AND, and OR. All these operators are
        left-associative.
      </item>
      <item>
        The commas used to separate the values are interpreted as OR operators, so "Type:Fixture1,Fixture2"
        is equivalent to "Type:Fixture1 or Type:Fixture2".
      </item>
      <item>
        White-space is ignored outside quoted strings, so "Type:Fixture1|Type:Fixture2" is equivalent
        to "Type : Fixture1 | Type : Fixture2".
      </item>
      <item>
        Commas, colons, slashes, backslashes and quotation marks can be escaped with a backslash. For
        example, \' will be interpreted as '. Using a single backslash in front of any other character
        is invalid.
