    /// The Gallio.Framework.Pattern namespace provides the Pattern Test Framework which
    /// can serve as the foundation for building new test frameworks.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    /// The Pattern Test Framework is based on the idea of extensible and composable units
    /// called patterns (<see cref="IPattern"/>).  Patterns are usually encoded as .Net attributes
    /// and applied to test assemblies, types and members to define tests.

    /// MbUnit is based on the Pattern Test Framework.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// If you are implementing a new attribute-based test framework then you may find it
    /// beneficial to extend the Pattern Test Framework.  Alternately you may implement
    /// <see cref="ITestFramework"/> directly.
