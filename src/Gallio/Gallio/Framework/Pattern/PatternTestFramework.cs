    /// <para>
    /// The pattern test framework does not provide many attributes that end-users would use
    /// to write tests.  The framework is intended to be extended by 
    /// components and libraries that define the test syntax and other facilities.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// For example, a Test-Driven framework would augment the base framework with a syntax based
    /// around test fixtures, test methods and assertions.  A Behavior-Driven framework
    /// would instead use a syntax based around contexts and specifications.  Both frameworks
    /// would share the common attribute-based model provided by the pattern test framework.
    /// They may even interoperate to a large extent.
    /// </para>

    /// Other add-on libraries and tools may further contribute functionality to the pattern
    /// test framework by registering components with the runtime or by subclassing

    /// Gallio supports the use of multiple test frameworks.  The pattern test framework
    /// model defined here may not be appropriate for all purposes.  Therefore you may

    /// construction process performed by <see cref="IPattern" /> and the kind of pattern matching
    /// that is performed by a recursive descent parser.  Each primary <see cref="IPattern" /> can be
    /// thought of as a grammar rule that matches a given code element and describes how further
    /// matching of nested code elements is intended to occur.  The actual matching performed is
    /// somewhat simplistic (largely based on attribute lookup) but on the whole the framework
    /// provides a quite flexible implementation pattern for a wide variety of testing features.
