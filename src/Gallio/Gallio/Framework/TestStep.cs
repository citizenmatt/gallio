    /// The number of steps within a test does not need to be known ahead of time.

    /// There are many interesting uses for steps.  For example:
    /// <list type="bullet">
    /// <item>A single test consisting of a long sequence of actions can be subdivided
    /// into steps to simplify analysis.</item>
    /// <item>A test might depend on environmental configuration that cannot be
    /// known a priori.</item>
    /// <item>A performance test might be scheduled to run for a certain duration
    /// but the total number of iterations is unknown.  By running each iteration
    /// as a step within a single test, the test report can display the execution
    /// log and pass/fail result of each iteration independently of the others.</item>
    /// <item>A script-driven test driver could execute a scripted sequence of verification
    /// commands as a distinct step.  If the script is written in a general purpose
    /// programming language, the total number of commands and the order in which they
    /// will be performed might not be known ahead of time.  Using steps enables the
    /// integration of tests written in forms that cannot be directly adapted
    /// to the framework's native testing primitives.</item>
    /// <item>When testing non-deterministic algorithms, it is sometimes useful to repeat
    /// a test multiple times under slightly different conditions until a certain level
    /// of confidence is reached.  The variety of conditions tested might be determined
    /// adaptively based on an error estimation metric.  Using steps each condition
