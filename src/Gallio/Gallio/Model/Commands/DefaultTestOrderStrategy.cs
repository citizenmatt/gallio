    /// This default strategy first compares test by explicit ordering (using <see cref="Test.Order"/>)
    /// then defines an implicit ordering by name (using <see cref="TestComponent.Name"/>).

    /// Why implicitly order tests by name instead of randomly?
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// It is my belief that ordering tests by name significantly eases test result interpretation
    /// because the test results are produced in a meaningful and predictable order.  If the implicit
    /// order is known, then it's easier for a tester to guage test progress by inspecting the name
    /// of the currently executing test (in addition to using cues provided by progress monitors, of course).
    /// Related tests also tend to have similar names or share a common prefix so sorting by name
    /// can effectively cluster these tests together thereby providing feedback about related topics
    /// around the same time.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// A tester may of course take advantage of this known ordering to produce tests that are
    /// dependent upon one another without making that clear in the code by specifying explicit test
    /// dependencies or ordering.  When a test is renamed, the implicit ordering will change, possibly
    /// causing other tests to fail.  However, it is not Gallio's objective to police
    /// testers, who may well adopt any number of inadvisable practices to meet their ends.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Nevertheless, any test framework is still free to produce a random ordering of independent tests.
    /// It suffices for the framework to initialize the <see cref="Test.Order" /> property of each of its
    /// testsw to a distinct random number. Problem solved.
