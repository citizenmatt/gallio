    /// This environment disables <see cref="WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext.AutoInstall" />
    /// because it can cause problems with tests that use Windows Forms and that require COM
    /// message pumping.  Just because a thread happens to instantiate a Control does
    /// not imply that it should always be enlisted into the Windows Forms synchronization context.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Specifically this setting change resolves an obscure hangs that can occur.  Creating
    /// a <see cref="Form" /> will auto-register the WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext.  This
    /// is fine as long as a message pump is running in the thread.  However as is typical with
    /// tests, such message pumps are short-lived so soon enough there is no pump.
    /// Now when a system event like UserPreferenceChanged occurs, the <see cref="SystemEvents" />
    /// class will try to synchronize with the registered handler using a WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext
    /// but there is no pump running.  The call hangs indefinitely.  What's more, the test
    /// runner will not be able to unload the AppDomain because it will remain stuck in
    /// native code!

    /// As a work-around, we disable auto-installation of the Windows Forms synchronization context.
