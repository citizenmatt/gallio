    /// The linking mechanism works by defining a field or property of the mixin's
    /// type on the test fixture which is to acquire new functionality.
    /// Unlike abstract test fixture base class, multiple mixins can be linked into
    /// a single test fixture.  It is also possible to create composite mixins
    /// that express the behavior of multiple mixins taken together.

    /// A mixin typically expresses a single test infrastructure concern.  For example,
    /// preparing an empty database, starting / stopping a server, checking common

    /// a web browser for integration testing.
