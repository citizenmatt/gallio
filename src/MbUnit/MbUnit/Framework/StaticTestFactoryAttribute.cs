    /// The tests created by the static test factory are considered to be children
    /// of the fixture that contains the factory method that generated them.
    /// Because the tests are created statically, they will appear in the test
    /// runner and they can be filtered as usual.  However, this means that the
    /// tests will be generated only when the fixture is being explored rather
    /// than each time the fixture is executed.  It also means that the factory
    /// method must be static and cannot be parameterized.

    /// The method to which this attribute is applied must be declared by the
    /// fixture class.  It must be static and must not have any parameters.

    /// <para>
    /// Tests built by a <see cref="StaticTestFactoryAttribute" /> will not be visible in ReSharper
    /// and other test runners that rely only on source code and metadata exclusively.
    /// This is because the test factory must be executed in order to populate the list of tests
    /// but the code might not be available in a compiled form during test exploration.  The
    /// tests should still run as part of the containing fixture although the results may
    /// only be visible in the full test report.
